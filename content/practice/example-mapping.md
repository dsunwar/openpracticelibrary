## What is it?

Example mapping is a technique for fleshing out and gaining clarity around the acceptance criteria for a given story. Example mapping uses four different colors of sticky notes, which are:

1. Yellow - for the story itself (as a header for the example map)
2. Blue - for specific rules associated with the story
3. Green - for examples of rules
4. Red - for questions that arise during the discussion

Begin by selecting a story and write it on a yellow sticky note. Place it at the top of your example map as a header. In a horizontal row underneath that, begin writing business rules on blue sticky notes. Beneath the blue business rules, create columns of green sticky notes with individual examples of those business rules. These could be relatively unstructured, Friends-style "The one where..." examples, or full blown Gherkin criteria. As misunderstandings arise surrounding individual examples or entire business rules, add red stickies with questions written on them if the right people to answer the question or resolve the misunderstanding are not in the room.

## Why use it?

Example mapping can be used with a team and stakeholders as a tool to ensure that the team appropriately understands what is expected as a part of the story. It gets the stakeholders involved in the development of acceptance criteria, and may bring to light misunderstandings while discussing specific examples of business rules.

Most of all: Multiple examples of specific cases convey information better than a single bad abstraction of a concept.
