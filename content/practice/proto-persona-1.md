## What is proto-persona?

Proto-personas in Lean UX are like personas but without validation through months of lengthy expensive research studies. This is a ad-hoc persona created by need to begin work on a product immediately, not spending too much time in research. These personas are built with assumptions with knowledge of team and stakeholders. Over the course of the project, the proto-persona can be updated more accurately to reflect the user with what we learn throughout the process. For e.g: survey, user interview, usability testing and so on.

## Why use proto-persona?

* **Shared understanding:**\
  This process helps everyone in the team to build a common vocabulary of the users they will design and develop. As a result decision making will be easier and designing product will be more focused.
* **Help prioritise:**\
  Having a clearly stated persona attributes also helps in decision making quicker. This will help prioritising and agree on which feature will be more beneficial for the well defined personas.
* **Drives focus:**\
  Helps the team focus on the goal and targeted users throughout.
* **Avoid risky knowledge gap:**\
  There is a risk in knowledge gap between the team who creates persona and who uses them for e.g: external research team and the team working on the project. There is a risk of not learning about users throughout the product design cycle. In Lean UX approach, the team creates the proto-persona together and validates them throughout their learnings.
* **Iterative approach:**\
  In Lean UX, persona is not one-time activity whereas the persona goes through multiple iterative process through learnings.
* **Recruiting correct user type for usability testing:**\
  This also helps in prioritising for future usability testing on the focus user groups to validate the assumptions.

## How to create and use proto-persona?

* It is best to create the persona together in a team to build shared understanding so everyone feels contributed and buys-in on the final persona.
* Discuss the group of users you have identified in user journey mapping, event storming and so on. List them down in posted note and discuss among the team and focus on the primary, secondary or focused user group whose problem you are trying to solve as a team.
* Use the template or draw to list down their Attributes, Goal, Obstacles. Ofcourse, do not forget to give your persona a name.
* Finally, put it on the wall and discuss in a team on your findings to built a consensus. Agree collectively as a team on the persona that suits your projects.
